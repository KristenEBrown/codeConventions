# Java Code Conventions

This guide is meant to serve as a standard for writing clean, readable code in an aim to be consistent between projects and increase longevity.  Most software will be maintained by people other than the original author throughout its lifecycle, so it is important to create your project in a manner others can understand quickly, easily, and thoroughly.  Following these guidelines will help to create sustainable and consistent software across authors.  While you should try to adhere to these guidelines, readability trumps these rules and you should use your best judgement.
