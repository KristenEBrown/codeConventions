# Java Code Conventions

This guide is meant to serve as a standard for writing good, readable code in an aim to be consistent between projects and increase longevity.  Code should be written for ease of use by future programmers, and while you should try to adhere to these guidelines, readability trumps these rules and you should use your best judgement.

Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
  * 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
  * Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
  * Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly
  * If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create.
