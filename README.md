**Standardized Coding Conventions in Java for Delta Information Technology**

Updated coding conventions in Java for use by Delta's IT department built off of the existing code conventions document in order to standardize coding practices accross departments in an modern manner.

Major contributions to the existing code convention document from Peter King, Patrick Naughton, Mike Demoney, Jonni Kanerva, Kathy Walrath, and Scott Hommel.  Original document reflects the Java language coding standards presented in the *Java Language Specification*, from Sun Microsystems.  Updates will be created referencing the *Google Java Style Guide*, which can be found on [Google's Github] (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) and is licensed under the [CC-By 3.0 License] (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
